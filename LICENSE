  Sounds (sfx/) released under the same license as Images
    Note that the sounds were generated via SFXR http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html and BFXR http://www.bfxr.net/
    This doesn't have any license complications as far as I know, I just wanted to link those tools
  Background images (images found in stages/) were found on a Google image source, license unknown.

WORKS OF OTHERS
  The music files (bgm/) were created from MIDIs released under Creative Commons license by their artist, 'Morusque', found here: http://ccmixter.org/files/Nurykabe/10176
  The MIDI files were converted to OGGs via a SoundFont found here: http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/fluid-soundfont-gm

  According to the package maintainer's copyright file ( http://ftp-master.metadata.debian.org/changelogs//main/f/fluid-soundfont/fluid-soundfont_3.1-5_copyright ),
  the SoundFont is released under MIT, therefore I'm going to assume the MIDIs' resulting sound files are under the same license as the MIDIs themselves, and attribute them to Morusque
